Code is included in two jupyter notebooks in the starter_code folder.
-The WeatherPy.ipynb file contains data analysis on city weather data from citipy and the OpenWeatherMap api.
-The VacationPy.ipynb file contains an analysis of hotel data using citipy and the Geoapify Places api.
-Both notebooks import an api key from the starter_code folder in a file that was not included in the github repo, called api_keys.py
City output data and output figures for WeatherPy.ipynb are stored in the output_files folder.
The only file listed in the .gitignore file was api_keys.py to keep my api keys private.
